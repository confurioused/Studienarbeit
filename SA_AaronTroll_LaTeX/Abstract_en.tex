\section{Abstract}

Periodic leg movements during sleep are symptoms of many medical conditions, which can be recorded on a polysomnogram. The number of PLM per hour (PLM-Index) can indicate how much the sleep is disturbed. In order to automatically determine the PLM-Index, event detectors are used. 

This work investigates the comparability of event detectors and shows that the previously used metrics are limited in their evaluation capabilities. The cost-functional proposed in this work is described by the sum of the errors made by the detector in determining the PLM-Index. 
In addition, ideas are proposed to increase the descriptiveness of the cost-functional and to extract further information about the detector from the annotation signals.
The developed metrics are evaluated on a detector from the literature \cite{Moore} using a dataset of the University Hospital Dresden \ref{chap:Datensatz}.
