   abstract = {Movement in bed may be an indicator of health problems, i.e., the alteration of the pattern or amount of motor activity can be a disease marker. It can reflect illnesses ranging from flu to depression, pain, or the side effects of certain treatments. There are also motor disturbances that are triggered by sleep such as restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements during sleep that reduce sleep quality. The assessment of nocturnal motor disturbances in sleep is traditionally performed through overnight polysomnography or actigraphy. In this paper, we investigate the use of unobtrusive sensors (load cells) installed under the supports of a bed to assess movements in bed. Body and leg movements are discriminated using a linear classifier with features derived from load cell signals. Leg movements are scored as periodic leg movements using the criteria defined by The World Association of Sleep Medicine, and a periodic leg movement index is estimated. The system is validated against technicians' annotations of body movements and leg movements (scorings from EMG data) collected from 17 patients during a one night polysomnogram exam. The classification rate is equal to 97\%, and the Spearman's correlation coefficient between the periodic leg movement indexes estimated by the system and those obtained from polysomnogram is 0.927. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using load cells for movement classification and detection of periodic leg movements. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Analyses of sleep-related movement disorders have gained importance due to an increase in life expectancy. The present approaches for measuring movements are based on electromyography or accelerometry and provide only local or specific results from muscles/limbs to which sensors have been attached. The motivation of this work was to investigate the detection of a more complete spectrum of sleep-related movements using a three-dimensional (3D) camera instead of the current conventional methods. In contrast to most of the previously published literature, this method allows for the detection of movements even when patients are covered with a blanket. This is the first work to evaluate movement detection with a clinical dataset and replicate the clinical environment in a laboratory setup. The laboratory setup allowed for the characterization of detectable movements through the determination of speed and amplitude limits. We used the Kinect One time-of-flight sensor to record 3D videos. Movements were quantified based on the temporal depth change in these 3D videos. A computer-controlled lifting table allowed for the controlled simulation of movements. Our algorithm detected movements with amplitude values >3.0 mm and velocity values >3.5 mm/s with an F1 score ≥95\%. The shortest reliably detected duration of movement was 350 ms. In an ethically approved clinical study including 44 patients, 93.1\% of electromyography-detected leg movements were also found in 3D. A significant correlation ( ρ = 0.86 ) was found between movements detected by the 3D system and polysomnography. The 3D system detected 31.2\% more movements than electromyography. In addition to obtaining a broader spectrum of movements not limited to local and muscle/limb-specific movements, the usage of a contactless 3D camera simplifies the recording setup and preserves natural sleeping behavior. The presented 3D system may become useful for diagnostic purposes during sleep studies.},

The system is robust to time-varying illumination conditions while using standard camera and infrared illumination hardware. We tested the system for periodic limb movement (PLM) detection during sleep, using EMG signals as a reference. We evaluated the motion detection performance both per frame and with respect to movement event classification relevant for PLM detection. The Matthews correlation coefficient improved by a factor of 2, compared to a state-of-the-art motion detection method, while sensitivity and specificity increased with 45\% and 15\%, respectively. Movement event classification improved by a factor of 6 and 3 in constant and highly varying lighting conditions, respectively. On 11 PLM patient test sequences, the proposed system achieved a 100\% accurate PLM index (PLMI) score with a slight temporal misalignment of the starting time ($<$1 s) regarding one movement. We conclude that camera-based PLM detection during sleep is feasible and can give an indication of the PLMI score. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Background: Periodic leg movements (PLM) during sleep (PLMS) are considered strongly related to restless legs syndrome (RLS), and are associated with polymorphisms in RLS risk genes. Various software for automatic analysis of PLMS are available, but only few of them have been validated. Aim of this study was to validate a leg movements count and analysis integrated in a commercially available polysomnography (PSG) system against manual scoring. Methods: Twenty RLS patients with a PLMS index > 20/h and 20 controls with a PLMS index < 5/h were included. Manual and computerized scoring of leg movements (LM) and PLM was performed according to the standard American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria. LM and PLM indices during sleep and wakefulness, the rate of PLMS associated with respiratory events, intermovement interval and periodicity indices were manually and automatically scored. Results: The correlation between manual and computerized scoring was high for all investigated parameters (Spearman correlation coefficients 0.751-0.996, p < 0.001; intraclass correlation coefficients 0.775-0.999, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed high agreement between manual and automatic analysis. Conclusions: This study validated an automatic LM count and PLM analysis against the gold standard manual scoring according to AASM criteria. The data demonstrate that the software used in this study has an outstanding performance for computerized LM and PLM scoring, and LM and PLM indices generated with this software can be reliably integrated in the routine PSG report. This automatic analysis is also an excellent tool for research purposes.},

   abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in adults, and incurs a significant economic burden to society. Periodic limb movements (PLMs) in sleep are repetitive movements involving the great toe, ankle, and hip. Evolving evidence suggests that PLMs may be associated with high blood pressure and stroke, but this relationship remains underexplored. Several issues limit the study of PLMs including the need to manually score them, which is time-consuming and costly. For this reason, we developed a novel automated method for nocturnal PLM detection, which was shown to be correlated with (a) the manually scored PLM index on polysomnography, and (b) white matter hyperintensities on brain imaging, which have been demonstrated to be associated with PLMs. Our proposed algorithm consists of three main stages: (1) representing the signal in the time–frequency plane using time–frequency matrices (TFM), (2) applying K-nonnegative matrix factorization technique to decompose the TFM matrix into its significant components, and (3) applying kernel sparse representation for classification (KSRC) to the decomposed signal. Our approach was applied to a dataset that consisted of 65 subjects who underwent polysomnography. An overall classification of 97\% was achieved for discrimination of the aforementioned signals, demonstrating the potential of the presented method.},

The gold standard for LM detection consists of visual analysis of tibialis left (TIBL) and right (TIBR) electromyographic (EMG) signals. Such analysis is subjective and time-consuming. We here propose a semi-supervised and data-driven approach for LM detection during sleep that was trained and tested on 27 healthy controls (C) and 36 PLMD patients. After preprocessing of the EMG signals, discrete wavelet transform (Daubechies 4 mother wavelet and down to 4 th decomposition level) was applied. EMG was reconstructed for each set of detail coefficients, thus obtaining four signals (D1-D4). The pre-processed EMG and D1-D4 signals were divided in 3-s mini-epochs of which traditional EMG features were calculated. Based on the assumption of lack of movements in healthy controls during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, we used the features during REM of a subgroup of C to build a non-parametric probabilistic model defining the resting EMG distribution. This model was then used to classify the remaining mini-epochs as either resting EMG or LM. The percentages of 3-s mini-epochs with LMs were calculated for each subject and used to distinguish the remaining C and PLMD with a support vector machine and 5-fold cross validation scheme. Results showed that C can be distinguished by PLMD with accuracy higher than 82\% in the preprocessed EMG and D1-D3 signals.},

   abstract = {Numerous sleep disorders are characterised by movement during sleep, these include rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and periodic limb movement disorder. The process of diagnosing movement related sleep disorders requires laborious and time-consuming visual analysis of sleep recordings. This process involves sleep clinicians visually inspecting electromyogram (EMG) signals to identify abnormal movements. The distribution of characteristics that represent movement can be diverse and varied, ranging from brief moments of tensing to violent outbursts. This study proposes a framework for automated limb-movement detection by fusing data from two EMG sensors (from the left and right limb) through a Dirichlet process mixture model. Several features are extracted from 10 second mini-epochs, where each mini-epoch has been classified as 'leg-movement' or 'no leg-movement' based on annotations of movement from sleep clinicians. The distributions of the features from each category can be estimated accurately using Gaussian mixture models with the Dirichlet process as a prior. The available dataset includes 36 participants that have all been diagnosed with RBD. The performance of this framework was evaluated by a 10-fold cross validation scheme (participant independent). The study was compared to a random forest model and outperformed it with a mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 94\%, 48\%, and 95\%, respectively. These results demonstrate the ability of this framework to automate the detection of limb movement for the potential application of assisting clinical diagnosis and decision-making.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose: A Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) script (MATPLM1) was developed to rigorously apply World Associations of Sleep Medicine (WASM) scoring criteria for periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) from bilateral electromyographic (EMG) leg recordings. This study compares MATPLM1 with both standard technician and expert detailed visual PLMS scoring. Methods and Subjects: Validation was based on a 'macro' level by agreement for PLMS/h during a night recording and on a 'micro' level by agreement for the detection of each PLMS from a stratified random sample for each subject. Data available for these analyses were from 15 restless leg syndrome (RLS) (age: 61.5 ± 8.5, 60\% female) and nine control subjects (age: 61.4 ± 7.1, 67\% female) participating in another study. Results: In the 'micro' analysis, MATPLM1 and the visual detection of PLMS events agreed 87.7\% for technician scoring and 94.4\% for expert scoring. The technician and MATPLM1 scoring disagreements were checked for 36 randomly selected events, 97\% involved clear technician-scoring error. In the 'macro' analysis, MATPLM1 rates of PMLS/h correlated highly with visual scoring by the technician (r2 = 0.97) and the expert scorer (r2 = 0.99), but the technician scoring was consistently less than MATPLM1: median (quartiles) difference: 10 (5, 23). There was little disagreement with expert scorer [median (quartile) difference: -0.3 (-2.4, 0.3)]. Conclusions: The MATPLM1 produces reliable scoring of PLMS that matches expert scoring. The standard visual scoring without careful measuring of events tends to significantly underscore PLMS. These preliminary results support the use of MATPLM1 as a preferred method of scoring PLMS for EMG recordings that are of a good quality and without significant sleep-disordered breathing events.},

The objective of this study is to design and validate an end-to-end deep learning system for the automatic scoring of LMs and PLMS in sleep. Methods: The deep learning system was developed, validated and tested, with respect to manual annotations by expert technicians on 800 overnight PSGs using a leg electromyography channel. The study includes data from three cohorts, namely, the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC), Stanford Sleep Cohort (SSC) and MrOS Sleep Study. The performance of the system was further compared against individual expert technicians and existing PLM detectors. Results: The system achieved an F1 score of 0.83, 0.71, and 0.77 for the WSC, SSC, and an ancillary study (Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, MrOS) cohorts, respectively. In a total of 60 PSGs from the WSC and the SSC scored by nine expert technicians, the system performed better than two and comparable to seven of the individual scorers with respect to a majority-voting consensus of the remaining scorers. In 60 PSGs from the WSC scored accurately for PLMS, the system outperformed four previous PLM detectors, which were all evaluated on the same data, with an F1 score of 0.85. Conclusions: The proposed system performs better or comparable to individual expert technicians while outperforming previous automatic detectors. Thereby, the study validates fully automatic methods for scoring LMs in sleep.},
